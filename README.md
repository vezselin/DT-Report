# Sleep Analysis Project

Data analysis of sleep patterns and bedroom environment using Python and Pandas.

## Data Sources

- `survey-responses.csv` - Daily sleep survey data (bedtime, sleep latency, rested levels)
- `devices-data.csv` - Arduino DHT11 sensor data (temperature and humidity)

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## Analysis

- Sleep latency trends
- Bedtime patterns
- Bedroom temperature during sleep window (21:00-02:00)
- Correlation between temperature and sleep quality
